# SDS/MTH 220

Homepage source code for 2018-09 Fall Smith College SDS/MATH 220: Intro to Probability and Statistics <https://github.com/smetzer180/SDS220/>. Most of the content is in either:

* `index.Rmd`: a single Moodle-style page that lists all announcements, lectures notes, and problem sets/homeworks in chronological order.
* `syllabus.Rmd`
