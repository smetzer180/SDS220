## Announcements

* Updated Midterm II instructions:
    + Bring a calculator! Scientific calculators ok, mobile phones not. 
    + Cover page posted.
* Project proposal feedback delivered. Many groups had a very right-skewed explanatory and/or outcome variable. In those cases, do a `log10()`-transformation as seen in the "Modeling with data in the tidyverse" course where we `mutate()` new `log10_price` and `log10_size` variables.


## Today's Topics/Activities

### 1. Chalk Talk

Observational studies vs randomized experiments. In particular recall from PS04:

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}

# Lec 22: `r emo::ji("halloween")`Wed 10/31`r emo::ji("halloween")` {#Lec22}

## Announcements

* No lab Tuesday 11/20.
* Go over practice midterm questions

## Today's Topics/Activities

### 1. Chalk Talk

Causal Inference

### 2. In-class exercise

* Look at [Spurious Correlations](http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations){target="_blank"}
* Read ModernDive 6.3.2


### 3. Install development version of moderndive package

We're going to install the development AKA [beta-version](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/beta_version){target="_blank"} of the `moderndive` package, which as of this morning includes a new function `gg_parallel_slopes()` allowing you to create a ggplot of the **parallel slopes model**. Note, this function is an inelegant hack but it gets the job done (source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/moderndive/moderndive/blob/geom_parallel_slopes/R/ggplot_parallel_slopes.R){target="_blank"}).

1. Install the `devtools` package as you normally would install a package. Say yes to any prompts.
2. Run the following line in your console to install the development version of the `moderndive` package off of GitHub.com, specifically the `geom_parallel_slopes` branch:  
`devtools::install_github("moderndive/moderndive", ref = "geom_parallel_slopes")`
3. Run `library(moderndive)` to reload the package.
3. Run `?gg_parallel_slopes` and see if the help file pops up. If it does, your installation worked!
4. Run example code at the bottom of the help file to see it in action! You should get the following plot:

### 2. In-class exercise

Read ModernDive Chapter 7.2.1 & 7.2.2. 

### 3. Tweet of the day

In order for me to be able to recreate/reproduce/replicate your work, I need:

1. Access to your data! If you only submitted a `project_proposal.R` file but not the `.csv`/`.xlsx` data file, I can't recreate/reproduce/replicate your graphs! 
1. If the code that loads your `.csv`/`.xlsx` data file looks something like  
`read_csv("~/Desktop/My Smith Work/2018-19/Term Project/my_data.csv")`  
When I run this code it won't load the data since the `my_data.csv` file will not be in the same folder **on my computer**.

**Suggested approach**: Instead of submitting `.csv`/`.xlsx` data files on Moodle, publish your data to the web and load into R from there!

1. Click on tweet below to see all steps
1. Publish your data to the web (only if it is non-sensitive nor non-private)
1. Update your project proposal with the `read_csv("WEBLINK TO YOUR DATA")` code that loads the data and test all your code to ensure it all runs.
1. **Group leader only**: Resubmit your `project_proposal.R` file in a Slack group DM that has me and all your group members by Saturday 10/27 at 5pm. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey data science ed types!

# Lec 15: Fri 10/12 {#Lec15}

## Announcements

* Posted (imperfect) grading rubrics underneath each Problem Set on [Problem Sets](PS.html) page:
    + I only have one grader in this course who is an undergrad. Giving detailed feedback is hard; so I ask you to compare your solutions to the posted solutions and do a "self-evaluation." However, you will get lots of feedback at every stage of the project!
    + I need a mechanism for rewarding students who do something "extra" or "exceptional." However this will always be only a small portion of grade. Think of "extra" or "exceptional" this way:
        1. What is a checklist of criteria for a "great" calculus assignment?
        1. What is a checklist of criteria for a "great" essay?
        1. Guess what the term project for this course and hence also all the practice problem sets are more like? A calculus assignment or an essay?
    + Going forward, however, I will post the (imperfect) grading rubric ahead of time. 
    + Keep in mind the problem sets are worth 10% of final grade, and two lowest ones are dropped.
* Added hints to PS05. 
* Where is the final project, and hence the course, heading? Some past final project [examples](term_project.html#past_examples). 
* Please only access ModernDive using the link on the course webpage. Because of webpage problems in the last few weeks, I've had to change where ModernDive was hosted (saved online).
* Upcoming schedule, so plan accordingly:
    + Tonite: Reminder of talk below.
    + Wed 10/17: In-class time to work on projects. Right after lecture I leave for the [2018 Women in Statistics and Data Science Conference](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/wsds/2018/conferenceinfo.cfm/){target="_blank"} along with Prof. Miles Ott and a group of Smithies who will be presenting. **I will be too busy to answer Slack questions until Sunday.**
    + Thu 10/18 Lab Sec 05: Jenny will be conducting a `dplyr` review session.
    + Fri 10/19: **No lecture! Project proposal due at 5pm!**.
    + Tue 10/23 Lab Sec 06: Jenny will be conducting a `dplyr` review session.

* Read ModernDive Chapters 6.3.1 and 6.1.2.
* Look at solutions below to "cleaning variable names" exercise from Lec11. What do I do if my data frame has horrible variable/column names? Copy and paste this code into your `scratchpad.R` and run all 4 steps individually. This will help for your projects.

```{r, eval = FALSE, paged.print = FALSE}
# Step 1: Manually create a data frame with ugly names
library(dplyr)
example_data_frame <- data_frame(
  `WEIRD !@$^&*() Variable.name` = c(1, 2, 3),
  `more  WEIRDNESS    %` = c("pamplemousse", "cran-raspberry", "tangerine")
)

# Look at these awful names!
example_data_frame

# Step 2: The janitor package to the rescue!
library(janitor)

# Step 3: Use the clean_names() function in the janitor package to create a new
# data frame with cleaner names
data_frame_with_cleaner_names <- example_data_frame %>% 
  clean_names()

# Step 4: Compare these column names with the ones from above. Much cleaner!
data_frame_with_cleaner_names
```


### 3. Tweet of the day

On writing "pseudocode": a rough outline that is "sort of" like code that outlines the steps of what your code will do. You can think of pseudocode as a "blueprint" of your "building"; before you build your building, you need a plan! Here are examples of "pseudocode" for the data wrangling exercise from Learning Check 5.19 in ModernDive on taking the data in `nycflights13` and computing [Available Seat Miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Available_seat_miles){target="_blank"}

    + Tuesday 10/2: ~~3-6pm~~ 2-4:30pm

    
## Today's Topics/Activities  

### 1. Chalk Talk

* What is modeling?
* What is R Markdown?

```{r, eval=TRUE, cache = TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(moderndive)

# Teaching evaluation score
?evals
ggplot(evals, aes(x = score)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25) +
  labs(x = "Teaching score", title = "Fig 1: Teaching evaluation scores at UT Austin")

# Seattle house prices (x-axis in original scale)
?house_prices
ggplot(house_prices, aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(x = "Price USD", title = "Fig 2.a): Seattle House Prices")
```

### 2. In-class exercise: R Markdown

At a couple of steps in this process, you may be asked to install packages. Say yes to all of them. 

1. **Fiddle with RStudio settings**:
    + Go to RStudio menu bar -> Tools -> Global Options... -> R Markdown
    + Uncheck box next to "Show output inline for all R Markdown Documents"
1. **Create new R Markdown `.Rmd` file**:
    + Go to RStudio menu bar -> File -> New File -> R Markdown 
    + Set "Title" to "My first R Markdown report" and "Author" as your name.
1. **"Knit" a report**:
    + Click on the disk icon and save this file as `firstname_lastname` somewhere on your computer. This will create a file called `firstname_lastname.Rmd`
    + Click the arrow next to "Knit" -> "Knit to HTML". An HTML webpage should pop up.
1. **Publish this report on web**:
    + Click on blue "Publish" button on top right
    + If you haven't previously, create an account on Rpubs.com. If you have previously, login.
    + Set "Title" to "My first R Markdown report" and "Slug" to "testing"
    + You should end up with a webpage that looks like this [one](http://rpubs.com/rudeboybert/testing){target="_blank"}.
    + Share the URL (webpage link) to your report to your project groupmates in a Slack DM.
1. **Update your report on web**:
    + Make some trivial change to your `testing.Rmd` file.
    + "Re-knit" your report and make sure your trivial change is reflected.
    + The blue "Publish" button should now read "Republish"
    + Click "Update existing"
    + Share the link to your updated report with your groupmates on Slack!

### 3. In-class exercise: ModernDive

* Read ModernDive from the beginning of Chapter 6 up to and including 6.1.1. Note:
    + Make sure to install all the new packages listed in "Needed Packages".
    + You can skip the DataCamp course for now; this will be assigned later.
* **Learning how to learn**: See if you can figure out how to use the `clean_names()` function referenced below. Ask your seatmates, me or the data assistant for help.

### 4. Tweet of the day

How quickly clean variable names; this might be useful for your projects. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">janitor::clean_names() is 💵💲💰! But wait, there&#39;s more! <a href="https://t.co/Rk1aZRZWq0">https://t.co/Rk1aZRZWq0</a> Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/samfirke?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@samfirke</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rstats</a> <a href="https://t.co/H9Bvde8roy">pic.twitter.com/H9Bvde8roy</a></p>&mdash; Albert Y.

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Test this function on `example_data_frame` below:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
example_data_frame <- data_frame(
  `WEIRD !@$^&*() Variable.name` = c(1, 2, 3),
  `more  WEIRDNESS    %` = c("pamplemousse", "cran-raspberry", "tangerine")
)

* From last time: Grouping then summarizing: First `group_by()` to group rows together (the grey, blue, green color assignment) then `summarize()` to get group-by-group summaries (a summary statistic for each color).
* Create new variables using `mutate()`
* Arrange rows using `arrange()` or `arrange(desc())`
* Subset columns with `select()`

### 2. ModernDive Roadmap Update

We just completed "just enough data science" (data visualization and data wrangling) to do the rest of ModernDive. In particular

* Data modeling with the `moderndive` package (top right blue box)
* Statistical inference with the `infer` package (bottom right blue box)

# Lec 6 {#Lec06}

## Announcements

* Curious about a career in data science? Then come for Emily Dodwell (class of 2011)'s talk "The Nuts and Bolts of a Data Science Career" on Monday 9/24; stay for the `r emo::ji("pizza")` lunch! Click [here](static/dodwell_talk.pdf){target="_blank"} for flyer.
* Problem set 2 posted [below](#PS02).
* Upcoming "Important dates" in schedule above:
    + [Project groups](term_project.html#groups) by this Friday 9/21
    + Self-scheduled Midterm I weekend of Friday 9/28
* Learning check solutions by Friday, I promise!
* Slack poll on `scratchpad.R`


## RStudio Desktop

In this week's lab sections you’ll get help installing R + RStudio on your computers; the instructions are in ModernDive 2.1.1. **Starting on Friday I will assume you are all using the desktop version of RStudio.** If you're still curious about RStudio Server & RStudio Cloud, check out these [notes](notes.html#server_cloud).

So after Friday you'll be responsible for installing R Packages as described in ModernDive 2.3. In other words, to use a package for the first time:

1. You'll need to install it once.
1. *Load/open* it using `library()` command. Ex: `library(nycflights13)`



## Todays Topics/Activities       

### 1. Chalk Talk: Histograms "binning" structure

Comparing Figures 3.10 and 3.11 in the ModernDive readings from Lec 5

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(nycflights13)
# Code to generate Fig 3.10 with bar border color white
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white")
# Code to generate Fig 3.11
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 60, color = "white")
```
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(nycflights13)
library(patchwork)
# Code to generate Fig 3.10
p1 <- ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white") +
  labs(title = "Fig 3.10: 30 bins")
# Code to generate Fig 3.11
p2 <- ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 60, color = "white") +
  labs(title = "Fig 3.11: 60 bins")
p1 + p2
```


### 2. Chalk Talk: Boxplots

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
example <- data_frame(
  values = c(1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 30)
)
```

Say we want to plot a boxplot of the following `r nrow(example)` values which are pre-sorted: 

> `r example %>% pull(values)`

They have the following *summary statistics*:


Min. | 1t Qu. | Median  | 3rd Qu.  |  Max. 
---- | ------- | ------  |  ------- | --- 
`r min(example$values)`  |  `r quantile(example$values, probs=0.25, type = 2)` |  `r median(example$values)`  |  `r quantile(example$values, probs=0.75, type=2)`  | `r max(example$values)`


Let's copare the points and the corresponding boxplot side-by-side with the values on the $y$-axis matching:

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
plot1 <- ggplot(example, aes(x=factor(1), y=values)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Points") +
  theme(
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank()
  )

plot2 <- ggplot(example, aes(x=factor(1), y=values)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot") +
  theme(
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank()
  )
plot1 + plot2
```

## Experimenting with RStudio Cloud

Experimenting with [RStudio Cloud](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/sites/default/files/eCOTS%202018%20-%20Frictionless%20onboarding%20to%20data%20science%20with%20RStudio%20Cloud.pdf){target="_blank"} (on RStudio's servers) instead of RStudio Server (on Smith College's Servers).

* Click [here](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/4441/join?access_code=KMu7j8TpEMdb1XCXB9Dbj%2B8%2F79dQaS1nchX2PCtO){target="_blank"} to join RStudio Cloud.
* Create an account by clicking the "Login with Google" button and use your Smith email.
* Give yourself whatever login name.
* In the "2018-09 SDS 220" space you should see a "coursework" project. Click on "Copy".
* Click where it says "coursework" and rename it "Firstname Lastname". For example in my case "Albert Kim".

## Announceme
nts

* Lab section Tuesday/Thursday:
    + Install R + RStudio on your computer
    + Start Problem set 2
* What my `scratchpad.R` looks like after Lec4. Yours shouldn't be *exactly* the same, but close.  
Note because I saved my work, `scratchpad.R` is written in black. If I had unsaved work, this would be written in red.  
![alt text](static/images/Lec4_scratchpad.png){ width=500px }

## Today's To
pics/Activities       

### 1. Chalk Talk

* Histograms visualize the *(empirical) distribution* of a numerical variable
* Facets + Histograms: Allow you to visualize *the conditional distribution* of a numerical variable

### 2. In-class exercise: Comment lines

In the screen shot of my `scratchpad.R` above, any line that starts with a `#` are called *comment lines*. They are ignored by R when you run them in the console. Run both these lines in the console separately:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
this is a comment line that R ignores that helps readers (including you!) understand code

# this is a comment line that R ignores that helps readers (including you!) understand code
```

Why does one line return an `Error` whereas the other doesn't?

### 3. In-class exercise: ModernDive

As marked in the Schedule at the top of this page, read ModernDive 3.5 and 3.6.

* Syllabus:
    + Added expectations to [Basic Information](syllabus.html#basicinfo) section.
    + Added note about when to do DataCamp courses to [syllabus](syllabus.html#datacamp): *You do not need to complete any DataCamp courses in preparation for future lectures; they will always be explicitly assigned and you will subsequently be given time during Tu/Th lab sections to do them.*
* Solutions to previous lecture's learning checks will be posted directly underneith question. Ex: Look at [LC2.1 Solutions](https://moderndive.netlify.com/2-getting-started.html#exploredataframes){target="_blank"} I just posted.


## Today's Topics/Activities       

### 1. Chalk Talk

The Grammar of Graphics: the theoretical underpinnings of statistical graphics.

### 2. In-class exercise: R code scratchpads

**Question**: Should I be copying/pasting/tweeking code directly in the console window?  
**Answer**: You can, but it makes saving work difficult. Instead, create a "scratchpad":

1. Create a new `.R` script: In RStudio Menu Bar -> File -> New File -> R Script. 
1. Save this as `scratchpad.R`
1. Copy/paste/tweak any code in your scratchpad, not in console window. For example, for this exercise write: `1+1`
1. To "run" code in the console (in other words tell R to "do this"), you can do one of the following:
    1. Copy it from scratchpad, then paste it in console, then hit enter.
    1. Highlight the code you want to run, then click on "Run"
    1. Highlight the code you want to run, then press control+enter on Windows/Unix/Chromebook or ⌘+enter on macOS.
1. Save and close the file.
1. In the Files panel, click on `scratchpad.R` to reopen your previously saved work.

### 3. In-class exercise: ModernDive

As marked in the Schedule at the top of this page, read ModernDive 3-3.3.1 (start of Chapter 3 to the end of 3.3.1).

* Do not ignore the "Needed Packages" section at the beginning. Recall:
    + The phone vs app analogy described in ModernDive 2.3.
    + If you are using RStudio Server in your browser, these packages come pre-installed.
    + If you are using RStudio Desktop installed on your computer, you'll have to ensure these packages are installed.
* Please skip the "Introduction to the Tidyverse" DataCamp course mentioned at the beginning of Chapter 3 for now.
* "Learning checks": These are practice problems that you do not need to submit. Should you write your answers down? If you feel like you would benefit, then yes! I will post solutions to the learning checks before the next lecture!
* **Note**: In this class, of the "Five Named Graphs" described in ModernDive 3.2, we'll only cover scatterplots, histographs, and boxplots; we'll be skipping linegraphs and barplots.

1. Go over ModernDive Chapter 2. Note:
    + You can skip all videos and linked DataCamp courses.
    + "Learning checks": These are practice problems that you do not need to submit. Should you write your answers down? If you feel like you would benefit, then yes! I will post solutions to the learning checks before the next lecture!

## Getting he
lp

A big part of learning data science tools is learning how to get help effectively. For example, in this course:

**In class**:

1. Ask yourself "Is this something I can Google?" Learning to use Google effectively is an important tool in a data scientist's toolbox.
1. Ask the people sitting next to you. 
1. Raise your hand to ask the data assistant or myself.

**Outside of class**:

1. Ask yourself "Is this something I can Google?" Learning to use Google effectively is an important tool in a data scientist's toolbox.
1. Ask yourself "Are there people I work with in class that I can Slack?"
1. If you all don't know, post a question on Slack in the `#r_questions` channel.
1. Visit the Spinelli Center for tutoring Sunday-Thursday 7-9pm (see [syllabus](syllabus.html#basicinfo) for more info).
